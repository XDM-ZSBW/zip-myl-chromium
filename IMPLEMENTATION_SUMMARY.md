  - Comprehensive testing of all API endpoints
  - Automated testing against production backend
  - Detailed test results and reporting
  - Error handling and validation

- **Test Results**:
  - ‚úÖ Health endpoint: Working (200 OK)
  - ‚úÖ Device registration: Working (201 Created)
  - ‚úÖ Pairing code generation: Working (200 OK)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication endpoints: Not yet implemented (404)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Thoughts endpoints: Not yet implemented (404)

### 5. **Security Audit** ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Security Review** (`SECURITY_AUDIT.md`):
  - Analyzed all security implementations
  - Identified strengths and areas for improvement
  - Provided detailed threat model analysis
  - Created security recommendations
  - Overall security rating: B+ (Good)

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **API Endpoints Integration**
```javascript
// Device Registration
POST /api/v1/encrypted/devices/register
// Returns: deviceId, sessionToken, fingerprint, keyId

// Pairing Code Generation
POST /api/v1/encrypted/devices/pairing-code
// Returns: pairingCode, expiresAt, expiresIn

// Trusted Devices Management
GET /api/v1/encrypted/devices/trusted
DELETE /api/v1/encrypted/devices/trusted/{deviceId}
```

### **Encryption Implementation**
```javascript
// AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation
const encryptionConfig = {
  algorithm: 'AES-GCM',
  keyLength: 256,
  ivLength: 12,
  tagLength: 16,
  pbkdf2Iterations: 100000,
  saltLength: 32
};
```

### **Device Fingerprinting**
```javascript
// SHA-256 hash of device characteristics
const deviceInfo = {
  userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
  platform: navigator.platform,
  language: navigator.language,
  timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
  extensionId: chrome.runtime.id
};
```

## üöÄ **Backend Integration Status**

### **Working Features**
- ‚úÖ Health monitoring
- ‚úÖ Device registration with secure tokens
- ‚úÖ Pairing code generation with expiration
